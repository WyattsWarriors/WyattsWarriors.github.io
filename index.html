Subject:  Wyatt’s Warriors<br>
&emsp;Wyatt’s Warriors is a foundation that has been committed to spreading awareness about congenital heart defects (CHDs) in Canada since 2009.  The foundation was formed in honour of its namesake, Wyatt Celsie, nephew of Laura Celsie, who was born with and succumbed complications from a CHD.  While the premise of Wyatt’s Warriors is to spread awareness about CHDs, not many people are aware of the existence of this organization aside from the staff and parents of patients at the cardiac care unit at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.<br>
&emsp;The organization is much smaller in scale compared to other non-profit organizations. While it is smaller it is possible for it to run more efficiently and effectively in terms of not only raising awareness about CHDs but also fundraising for its efforts.  At the moment, the organization is operated by one person who is acting director but on a volunteer basis.  The director currently has a full-time job therefore Wyatt’s Warriors has become a part-time focus which is one of the reasons why not many people know about the organization.  Fundraising for Wyatt’s Warriors is a challenge. Each year Wyatt’s Warriors hosts three major fundraising events, a gala (its largest and most complex event), a golf tournament and a Walk-A-Thon.  Ticket sales for the gala along with sponsorship and donations for the golf tournament and Walk-A-Thon have declined the past couple of years.  Other than family members of the director and parents of patients who know about Wyatt’s Warriors, the organization is in need of volunteers not only to help out when there are fundraising events happening; but to also assist the organization with its operations on a more consistent basis especially with marketing and promotion as well as fundraising.  While it is admirable that one person is taking on all the responsibilities of managing Wyatt’s Warriors, it is too much for one person to handle.  Running a non-profit organization requires at the very least a small team of three to five people.
