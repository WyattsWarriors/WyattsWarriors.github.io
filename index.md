Memorandum
----------

Date:  March 25, 2018
To:  Laura Celsie, Director
From:  Emalyn, Sukhdeep, Grace Castillo, Piyal, Zhaocheng & Zhiyu
Subject:  Wyatt’s Warriors

Wyatt’s Warriors is a foundation that has been committed to spreading awareness about congenital heart defects (CHDs) in Canada since 2009.  The foundation was formed in honour of its namesake, Wyatt Celsie, nephew of Laura Celsie, who was born with and succumbed complications from a CHD.  While the premise of Wyatt’s Warriors is to spread awareness about CHDs, not many people are aware of the existence of this organization aside from the staff and parents of patients at the cardiac care unit at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.  

The organization is much smaller in scale compared to other non-profit organizations. While it is smaller it is possible for it to run more efficiently and effectively in terms of not only raising awareness about CHDs but also fundraising for its efforts.  At the moment, the organization is operated by one person who is acting director but on a volunteer basis.  The director currently has a full-time job therefore Wyatt’s Warriors has become a part-time focus which is one of the reasons why not many people know about the organization.  Fundraising for Wyatt’s Warriors is a challenge. Each year Wyatt’s Warriors hosts three major fundraising events, a gala (its largest and most complex event), a golf tournament and a Walk-A-Thon.  Ticket sales for the gala along with sponsorship and donations for the golf tournament and Walk-A-Thon have declined the past couple of years.  Other than family members of the director and parents of patients who know about Wyatt’s Warriors, the organization is in need of volunteers not only to help out when there are fundraising events happening; but to also assist the organization with its operations on a more consistent basis especially with marketing and promotion as well as fundraising.  While it is admirable that one person is taking on all the responsibilities of managing Wyatt’s Warriors, it is too much for one person to handle.  Running a non-profit organization requires at the very least a small team of three to five people.






Executive Summary
-----------------

Wyatt’s Warriors is a not-for-profit organization that spreads awareness about congenital heart defects (CHDs). Wyatt’s Warriors was founded in 2009, after the tragic death of Wyatt Celsie, who succumbed to a congenital heart defect at the age of two. The organization is named after Wyatt to honor his memory. 

A congenital heart defect is a problem with the structure of the heart. It is present at birth. The defects can involve the walls of the heart, the valves of the heart, and the arteries and veins near the heart. They can disrupt the normal flow of blood through the heart. The blood flow can slow down, go in the wrong direction or to the wrong place, or be blocked completely. Congenital heart defects are the most common birth defect and the number 1 cause of death from a birth defect. They kill more children each year than all childhood cancers combined. One to three percent of Canadian newborns will be born with one of the 35 different types of CHDs. Very few people are even aware about the existence of CHDs. 

Located in Toronto, Wyatt’s Warriors consists of a small team of volunteers and a director. The current director is the aunt of the late Wyatt Celsie and is working a full-time day job. Therefore, running the non-profit has become a secondary priority for her. Wyatt's Warriors organizes three annual events.  Each event offers an opportunity for the community to come together and have fun while raising awareness and funds for the Labatt Family Heart Centre at the Hospital for Sick Children.  The three events are the following: a Walk-A-Thon, a Gala and a Golf tournament. The grand extravagant Gala is their largest and most complex event. Ticket sales for all three events have plummeted over the past few years. Furthermore, the organization is in dire need of donations and volunteers. Due to the shortage of volunteers, only the family and relatives of late Wyatt end up volunteering at the three events. They need volunteers to help with fundraising as well as running day-to-day operations. 

The greatest challenge for Wyatt’s Warriors has been their growth rate. Even though they have been around for a decade, they still operate like a non-profit in its initial stages. Among everything, Wyatt’s Warriors needs an elaborate strategy for the future ahead. To do this, they need a good marketing plan as well as means to attract more volunteers.

Firstly, their official website is outdated. It’s rarely updated. For a reference, their main page still has advertisements about the events in 2016. In addition, they don’t provide any information about congenital heart defects (CHDs) on their website directly, they rather provide links where people can go to learn more about them. Their website is so outdated that their “Donate Today” button is no longer working. Furthermore, their website links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube accounts. Which are also updated on an irregular basis. Their YouTube account has nothing that relates to Wyatt’s Warriors or congenital heart defects. A simple solution for them would be to remove the link to the associated YouTube account. They need to keep the public informed especially by the means of social media and they also need a proper website where people can read more about them or even donate to them.

To do this, they should redesign their website completely. They need to reach out to computer science especially web design majors at a local college or University and ask someone to redesign their website.  Many students would love to take on opportunity of working on projects like this just to establish themselves in the market.  Furthermore, it is very cost-effective as the organization would not have to pay for the redesign.  It will be a win-win situation for both parties. They should also add multi-language support to their website. Their website is currently only available in English, if they had it available in more languages they would be able to reach out to a people from different communities more easily. If they are unsuccessful at finding someone to do it for free then, they should outsource their web hosting. For only a small fraction of what it costs to build a website here, there are many qualified individuals around the globe that can easily rebuild a professional website. It generally costs around about $200 to $400. However, they still need to frequently update their social media channels to connect to more people.  In addition, they should add information about what CHDs are, how they are treated etc. on their website rather than direct the users to different websites. This way users would not have to go to a different webpage just to learn about the disease Wyatt’s Warriors is raising awareness for.

Another major drawback to Wyatt’s Warriors growth is the number of people working for it. Currently, it’s secondary priority for the director herself. If they want a rapid growth they need to be more involved in the community. They should find volunteer retirees to serve as board of directors, while the current director could serve as a spokesperson. Furthermore, to get more volunteers they should reach out to their local high schools are spread awareness there and recruit students willing to complete their 40-hour volunteer service with them. This way they’ll be able to spread awareness quickly. 

Furthermore, Wyatt’s Warriors needs to approach private sponsors for additional funding and support. Moreover, Wyatt’s Warriors should apply for government grants and funding ASAP as this will help secure financial stability for the organization, so it can hire staff and pay for advertising. In addition, they should try to host more and diversified type of events. They can host quarter-annually draw prizes starting from small prizes like consumer electronics and then gradually scale it up to bigger prizes as they sell more draw tickets in the future. They can also host other smaller events like bake sales and selling candies. They already sell merchandize branded as “Warrior Gear” at their annual golf tournaments. However, they could sell diversified types of mechanize like selling pencils at schools and marketing them as “all proceeds go to the Labatt Family Heart Centre at the Hospital for Sick Children”. 

Additionally, Wyatt’s Warriors should host events on key cultural and ethnic festivities to attract more people and spreading awareness to various cultural communities. We are certain these recommendations can attain a positive growth for Wyatt’s Warriors and help save more people diagnosed with Congenital heart defects.
