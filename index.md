Memorandum

Date:  March 25, 2018

To:  Laura Celsie, Director

From:  Emalyn, Sukhdeep, Grace Castillo, Piyal, Zhaocheng & Zhiyu

Subject:  Wyatt’s Warriors

Wyatt’s Warriors is a foundation that has been committed to spreading awareness about congenital heart defects (CHDs) in Canada since 2009.  The foundation was formed in honour of its namesake, Wyatt Celsie, nephew of Laura Celsie, who was born with and succumbed complications from a CHD.  While the premise of Wyatt’s Warriors is to spread awareness about CHDs, not many people are aware of the existence of this organization aside from the staff and parents of patients at the cardiac care unit at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.  

The organization is much smaller in scale compared to other non-profit organizations. While it is smaller it is possible for it to run more efficiently and effectively in terms of not only raising awareness about CHDs but also fundraising for its efforts.  At the moment, the organization is operated by one person who is acting director but on a volunteer basis.  The director currently has a full-time job therefore Wyatt’s Warriors has become a part-time focus which is one of the reasons why not many people know about the organization.  Fundraising for Wyatt’s Warriors is a challenge. Each year Wyatt’s Warriors hosts three major fundraising events, a gala (its largest and most complex event), a golf tournament and a Walk-A-Thon.  Ticket sales for the gala along with sponsorship and donations for the golf tournament and Walk-A-Thon have declined the past couple of years.  Other than family members of the director and parents of patients who know about Wyatt’s Warriors, the organization is in need of volunteers not only to help out when there are fundraising events happening; but to also assist the organization with its operations on a more consistent basis especially with marketing and promotion as well as fundraising.  While it is admirable that one person is taking on all the responsibilities of managing Wyatt’s Warriors, it is too much for one person to handle.  Running a non-profit organization requires at the very least a small team of three to five people.




Executive Summary
-----------------

Wyatt’s Warriors is a not-for-profit organization that spreads awareness about congenital heart defects (CHDs). Wyatt’s Warriors was founded in 2009, after the tragic death of Wyatt Celsie, who succumbed to a congenital heart defect at the age of two. The organization is named after Wyatt to honor his memory. 

A congenital heart defect is a problem with the structure of the heart. It is present at birth. The defects can involve the walls of the heart, the valves of the heart, and the arteries and veins near the heart. They can disrupt the normal flow of blood through the heart. The blood flow can slow down, go in the wrong direction or to the wrong place, or be blocked completely. Congenital heart defects are the most common birth defect and the number 1 cause of death from a birth defect. They kill more children each year than all childhood cancers combined. One to three percent of Canadian newborns will be born with one of the 35 different types of CHDs. Very few people are even aware about the existence of CHDs. 

Located in Toronto, Wyatt’s Warriors consists of a small team of volunteers and a director. The current director is the aunt of the late Wyatt Celsie and is working a full-time day job. Therefore, running the non-profit has become a secondary priority for her. Wyatt's Warriors organizes three annual events.  Each event offers an opportunity for the community to come together and have fun while raising awareness and funds for the Labatt Family Heart Centre at the Hospital for Sick Children.  The three events are the following: a Walk-A-Thon, a Gala and a Golf tournament. The grand extravagant Gala is their largest and most complex event. Ticket sales for all three events have plummeted over the past few years. Furthermore, the organization is in dire need of donations and volunteers. Due to the shortage of volunteers, only the family and relatives of late Wyatt end up volunteering at the three events. They need volunteers to help with fundraising as well as running day-to-day operations. 

The greatest challenge for Wyatt’s Warriors has been their growth rate. Even though they have been around for a decade, they still operate like a non-profit in its initial stages. Among everything, Wyatt’s Warriors needs an elaborate strategy for the future ahead. To do this, they need a good marketing plan as well as means to attract more volunteers.

Firstly, their official website is outdated. It’s rarely updated. For a reference, their main page still has advertisements about the events in 2016. In addition, they don’t provide any information about congenital heart defects (CHDs) on their website directly, they rather provide links where people can go to learn more about them. Their website is so outdated that their “Donate Today” button is no longer working. Furthermore, their website links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube accounts. Which are also updated on an irregular basis. Their YouTube account has nothing that relates to Wyatt’s Warriors or congenital heart defects. A simple solution for them would be to remove the link to the associated YouTube account. They need to keep the public informed especially by the means of social media and they also need a proper website where people can read more about them or even donate to them.

To do this, they should redesign their website completely. They need to reach out to computer science especially web design majors at a local college or University and ask someone to redesign their website.  Many students would love to take on opportunity of working on projects like this just to establish themselves in the market.  Furthermore, it is very cost-effective as the organization would not have to pay for the redesign.  It will be a win-win situation for both parties. They should also add multi-language support to their website. Their website is currently only available in English, if they had it available in more languages they would be able to reach out to a people from different communities more easily. If they are unsuccessful at finding someone to do it for free then, they should outsource their web hosting. For only a small fraction of what it costs to build a website here, there are many qualified individuals around the globe that can easily rebuild a professional website. It generally costs around about $200 to $400. However, they still need to frequently update their social media channels to connect to more people.  In addition, they should add information about what CHDs are, how they are treated etc. on their website rather than direct the users to different websites. This way users would not have to go to a different webpage just to learn about the disease Wyatt’s Warriors is raising awareness for.

Another major drawback to Wyatt’s Warriors growth is the number of people working for it. Currently, it’s secondary priority for the director herself. If they want a rapid growth they need to be more involved in the community. They should find volunteer retirees to serve as board of directors, while the current director could serve as a spokesperson. Furthermore, to get more volunteers they should reach out to their local high schools are spread awareness there and recruit students willing to complete their 40-hour volunteer service with them. This way they’ll be able to spread awareness quickly. 

Furthermore, Wyatt’s Warriors needs to approach private sponsors for additional funding and support. Moreover, Wyatt’s Warriors should apply for government grants and funding ASAP as this will help secure financial stability for the organization, so it can hire staff and pay for advertising. In addition, they should try to host more and diversified type of events. They can host quarter-annually draw prizes starting from small prizes like consumer electronics and then gradually scale it up to bigger prizes as they sell more draw tickets in the future. They can also host other smaller events like bake sales and selling candies. They already sell merchandize branded as “Warrior Gear” at their annual golf tournaments. However, they could sell diversified types of mechanize like selling pencils at schools and marketing them as “all proceeds go to the Labatt Family Heart Centre at the Hospital for Sick Children”. 

Additionally, Wyatt’s Warriors should host events on key cultural and ethnic festivities to attract more people and spreading awareness to various cultural communities. We are certain these recommendations can attain a positive growth for Wyatt’s Warriors and help save more people diagnosed with Congenital heart defects.




Problem Statement & Analysis
----------------------------

Although the organization has managed to survive for nearly a decade, Wyatt’s Warriors still operates like it is in its beginning stages; in other words, no growth.  We have used the SWOT analysis to evaluate Wyatt’s Warriors in order to better understand the organization’s need to gain further support which in turn will help in its growth and success.

### SWOT Analysis

Marketing Strategies
--------------------

Wyatt's Warriors Foundation was created to honor the memory of Wyatt and help families at a difficult time by providing comfort, support, education and encouragement to those affected by congenital heart defects. 

This mission is fulfilled through numerous objectives; however Wyatt’s Warriors is experiencing obstacles preventing its growth and further success.  Non-profit organizations highly rely on the publics’ assistance.  Recognizing public perception is imperative.  Without the publics’ support we cannot succeed.  We understand Wyatt’s Warriors resources are limited, however for its cause to be a priority, the message must be clearly communicated with a sense of urgency. This can be met with an effective marketing strategy.  The purpose of Wyatt’s Warriors marketing strategy should be to identify and then communicate the benefits of Wyatt’s Warriors to the target market. Without a successful marketing strategy, unnecessary resources will be used without results.

Non-profit organizations must clearly identify their target market; in this case the target being those that support Wyatt’s Warriors’ cause. Once this is established, you should establish communication channels to the target market.  These communication channels are usually focused on social media as they are easily accessible and cost-effective.  The following are some suggestions on where to begin with marketing Wyatt’s Warriors:

The most common channel is an organizational website. An informative website is imperative because it establishes the organization’s  message in a clear and concise manner.  Your target market will be able to research your organization and feel reassured towards supporting your cause. 

Utilize other common communication channels on the internet such as Charity Village and social media (i.e. Facebook, twitter, blogs, Buzzfeed, Youtube etc.).  These are free yet highly effective in terms of reaching a large amount of people. 

Paid Advertising:  These channels may be a bit more expensive, however provide and more direct access to your target market.  They provide more focus towards directing your message to the target market.  To start, Wyatt’s Warriors can advertise on the radio as it is the least expensive medium among compared to TV and print media.  

Create correspondence such as newsletters, e-newsletters, brochures and direct mail letters.  Once the target market initiates contact with your organization, you can establish a mailing list that will be able to communicate information of your cause directly with them. Other organizations such as the Canadian Cancer Society and the Heart and Stroke Foundation utilize mail correspondence to communicate their message effectively. 

Host more special events.  Currently Wyatt’s Warriors hosts three events annually, a gala, golf tournament and walk-a-thon.  While these events do a good job at raising awareness and funds for the organization, Wyatt’s Warriors should host more public events. Functions such as these allow the organization to communicate information to supporters in a more direct fashion frequently instead of just three times a year.  

Provide an annual report to your supporters. They will feel reassured that their resources are making a difference.



Operations and Fundraising Initiatives
--------------------------------------

Operations managers are core players in both the profit and non-profit organisations.  This is why it is important for Wyatt’s Warriors to have an ‘operations person’ who is present to run the organization on a consistent basis.

In a non-profit organisation they are responsible for directing fundraising efforts which requires many hours of planning.  He/she must be responsible for identifying the resources which mainly come from donors and fundraising activities.  He/She is also responsible for ensuring enough activities are planned to raise funds and direct the organisation’s funds to where it is most profitable.

For nearly a decade Wyatt’s Warriors hosts three fundraising events annually:

#### 1. Golfing 

Angus Glen Golf Club once a year in early summer/late spring, it is an all inclusive event of 100.00 per person with a culmination of an evening of relaxation around a bon fire.  This is done very at little cost to the club, since volunteers clean up after the event working alongside club staff who also offer their services to the cause.  Attendees are requested to bring along a pot luck to make the meal options wider.   Golf carts are available and are guided by the club staff.  Invitations are usually sent out to pro golfers to grace the occasion.

#### 2. Gala

This is held at banquet halls and is also an all inclusive a seven-course dinner.  Tickets are usually $200.00 per person.  It targets 500-700 persons.  Preparation, decorations and clean up is usually done by the volunteers. Live music is also provided by volunteer musicians and singers. Thankyou cards are placed at every seat with a survey card for the patrons to give their opinion for the next gala.

#### 3. Walk-A-thon

This is a 10 km walk and we ask donors to sponsor persons at 20.00 per every km walked by the person sponsored.  Our target is usually 50 to 100 participants.  We have observed that some donors just donate to the cause instead of sponsoring a participant.  

So far, through Wyatt’s Warriors fundraising efforts, the organization has raised about $250,000.  We believe there is definitely an opportunity for the organization to raise more funds by adding more events along with the marketing strategies previously mentioned.  Moreover, an operations manager who is available to work for the organization on a consistent basis could help make this possible.



Recommendations
---------------

Since Canada is one of the largest multicultural countries in the world, it is necessary for Wyatt’s Warriors to increase awareness among new immigrants.  Moreover, many newcomers may have children or relatives who suffer from CHDs, therefore if they know about the organization and its efforts to bring awareness about the disease, they can connect with others and share experiences.

1. The organization should optimize their online webpage and provide information in more languages because their target market are not only local residents but also the new arrivals in Canada who may not speak English. Therefore, it does help Wyatt’s Warriors to connect with a wider target market.  

2. The Wyatt’s Warriors should reorganize their program. Because even the director is working part-time currently in the organization. Therefore, they need to hire some professional employers such as supervisor, non-profit association executive director, program manager and so on, who has some experiences of running a non-profit organization and also can be a full-time worker. Then, improve the training and development of the staff through the new program in order to let the workers be responsible for their duty, and quiz the employees to ensure comprehension and set standards. A key implementation is to have the employees complete an anonymous survey to help with improvement of a future training session.

3. As a non-profit organization, the fundraising for Wyatt’s Warriors is a challenge. the organization should create a clear-cut business plan including fundraising ideas, and it will include each level of the management and supervision’s fundraising objective and goal. And the organization could look for sponsors and build up a cooperative relationship with some of the companies by offering free heart defect examination service to the workers once a year, and at the same time, Wyatt’s Warriors can get the financial support from those companies.  Moreover, Wyatt’s Warriors should apply for government grants and funding ASAP as this will help secure financial stability for the organization so it can hire staff and pay for advertising.

4. After Wyatt’s Warriors receives enough financial support, they could launch a larger advertising campaign to attract more attention. During this time, local newspaper and media outlets (radio, television, podcast, internet, social media, etc.), should be invited and included in covering events for the organization.

5. Because of Wyatt’s Warriors hosts three major fundraising events in each year, they could recruit high school volunteers who are looking for extra volunteer hours to complete their community hours and it is a good way to be cost-effective.  

6. Wyatt’s Warriors should host events on key cultural and ethnic festivities to attract more people and spreading awareness to different cultural communities. They should also organize draws and fundraisers to earn monetary funds for future operations. Furthermore, they should allow people to volunteer by cooking different foods for others to try out at their multicultural events.




Contingency Plan
----------------

The board of directors should develop a fund-raising committee to help fund extra activities for supporters and reward members for attendance and noticeable hard work. And, since the large advertising campaign is launched (after enough funds are raised), there will be more new people who are currently suffering from congenital heart defects, therefore, the program can also receive feedback from those new supporters. By reviewing the feedback, the organization could find out whether they are satisfied with the newly updated program service. And a faster implementation could be for Wyatt’s Warriors to leave donation boxes at school, government and any other public area for a collection of funds. Then, people and companies are always looking for ways to give back to the community, so this could simply require an advertisement online, in the newspaper or even through a church to gain awareness in the society.




Conclusion
----------

At this point in time it is in Wyatt’s Warriors best interest to transition its operations from a part-time non-profit organization to a full-time one.   This can be achieved by recruiting volunteers from local high schools, colleges and universities as well as retirees looking to help support a worthy cause.  This is a cost-effective solution until Wyatt’s Warriors can gain funding and become more financially stable.  As for raising funds, in addition to hosting more fundraising events, Wyatt’s Warriors should also explore funding streams such as government grants that are aligned with the scope of the organization.  In terms of marketing and raising awareness for the cause, Wyatt’s Warriors first step in making this possible is to update its website as soon as possible and utilize social media channels to boost its presence.  Once Wyatt’s Warriors gains some financial stability, the organization can pay for more advertising as well as hiring someone to look after the organization on a daily basis.
